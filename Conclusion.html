                Pinterest has its strengths and weaknesses in regard to usability and access. It features an overall appealing minimalistic design and has few major accessibility issues. 
                However, it is not flawless. Especially some minor features like the chat function, or the topics function are not as user friendly as they could be, and as the usability test has shown, 
                the website fails to offer its functionality to new users, despite its modern and minimalist layout.

                In terms of accessibility, the website follows a simple and logical layout and can be navigated only using the keyboard and the narrator. 
                That being said, it proved hard to reach the settings function without using a mouse, as neither the tab key nor arrow keys can be used to navigate the drop-down menu. 
                Apart from this flaw, the website can be navigated with relative ease.
